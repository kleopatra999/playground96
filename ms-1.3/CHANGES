1.1 -> 1.2
==========

   Fixed a small bug to do with signal handling that meant the message server
just hang.

   Moved the sigpause(0) in the 'loop' bit so that you don't have to wait for
a SIGALRM before the thing goes past it.

1.2 -> 1.3
==========

   General code cleanups.
   Added proper commandline options (see ms -h and README).
   Will now re-read message file if you give it a USR1 signal.
   Now converts '\n' in message file to '\n\r' so DOS/MS-Windows/VMS
      telnet clients should display the message correctly.
