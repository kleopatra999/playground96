When Mike and I were discussing the release of this code, one thing was
agreed on, "this will be the best thing and the worst thing for talkers."
In most people's opinions, there are really too many talkers today, and 
it is hard enough for the smaller ones to keep residents, yet at the same 
time there are talkers (let's not mention names :) that have literally 
hundreds of residents on at a time.    So I suppose as in the real world, 
there will always be a place for the small guy.
	This code was not released to saturate the talker world anymore 
than it already is, it was released to bring up the standard of the 
upstart scratch talker, and perhaps standardize the talker world in some
small way. It is still the job of the admins of a new talker to give 
their creation an identity of its own, but a few more features to offer 
residents never hurt anyone (like being able to set color if you are a 
color buff, etc).  
	Good luck with this program, and have as much fun as we did making
it a more fun place to be.    But remember the motto of the small talker,
"it isn't the code that makes a talker, its the people."
