Permission is hereby granted to any person to use, modify, and redistribute
this program for any non-profit purpose, subject to the following conditions.

1. You must not modify the pg_version function, or the version command that
   calls this function in any way, without the express written permission of
   at least 2 of the following people: Chris "astyanax" Allegretta, Michael
   "traP" Bourdaa, and Hans "Nogard" Petersen.

2. You must credit the following people permenantly in your message of the
   day:

<	
Burble (Simon Marsh), who wrote the origonal EW-too
Athanasius (Neil Soveran-Charley) who modified it to Summink,  
traP (Mike Bourdaa), astyanax (Chris Allegretta), Nogard (Hans Petersen) 
and vallie (Valerie Kelley) who modified it further into Playground 96.
<

You may use either "net" names, real names, or both.  The concept is
"credit where credit is due"

3. In a help 'credits' (or something similar) you must also credit the 
   following people:

<
For EW-Too, Chris Hughes and Jonathan Sloman, who made many advancements,

For Summink, Grim and Nicolai, who made signifigant changes, 
	   
For Playground 96, special thanks to some people who gave signifigant
   advice, hints, and/or inspiration at critical moments:

   sparky, alaric, Brann, snapper, subtle, DanS, Mantis, Oolon, 
   Currawong, nightshyfte, indieFan, shimone, aimee, and rafferty.

The reportto command was provided by Mantis from the Resort Online.

4. You agree that this program is provided on an "as-is" basis. No one who
   has worked on this program is required, nor expected, to provide any 
   sort of technical assistance for this program.  


5. If you choose to use the "report_to" code, you recognize that it was
   written by Mantis from the Resort, and as part of the agreement, you may 
   not remove the existing command aliases of "rpt" or "reportto" -- you may 
   add to it, if you wish, but those command names must exist, otherwise the 
   agreement allowing you to use those commands is voided.

6. If you choose to modify an existing talker with source code directly from,
   or based upon, the source code of Playground 96, you must make a specific
   note of this fact in your motd and help credits file: i.e.

"Parts of this program are based on PlayGround96 by traP, astyanax & Nogard"

7. This program cannot be used commercially. Here's why:

	"During late March of 1996, we recieved an offer from someone who
 	 was very interested in purchasing our program for a signifigant
	 amount of money, to use it as a web-chat with both telnet and
	 www access.  Needless to say, this would have been a revolution
	 in the talker worlds, giving the EW-too format a chance to compete
	 in the ever-expanding WWW arena, and it would have put cash in my
	 pocket to boot!  The deal was nixed by Burble, who threatened to sue
	 if the deal went through under any conditions and at any price -- we
	 were not even able to GIVE the code away, because the purpose they
	 had in mind for the program was of a commercial nature."

Nuff said. This is the #1 reason for my releasing the code at this time, in
 fact.  I'm currently working on a code that does not have this archaic 
 restriction (coding my own talker from scratch, no one can tell me what
 I can and can't do with it, after all), but that code will not, of course,
 be released like this version is. 

8. The SPODSORT program was written by traP (Mike Bourdaa) to provide a list
   of losers that spend way too much time on the program.  This program is
   provided on the same basis, and as part, of the Playground 96 release.
   (read spodsort.doc in talker/doc for how to use it) 

9. Update, written by Goliath, is also provided, and has been updated to 
   handle PG96 playerfiles by default.  Update is a hybrid at this point
   of Goliaths origonal version 1, and parts of PG96 code.  You must
   comply with Goliaths terms and conditions for using UPDATE in order to
   use that program.
