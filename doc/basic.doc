SU Policy as of 4/22/95

(1) Language - Foul language of any kind in the main rooms is NOT PERMITTED
ANYONE - not even sus. The first time a person swears in the mian room, a
simple 'please dont talk like that in the main room - it isnt allowed'
will suffice.  The second time a warn saying that the person was told is
okay and repeated swearing should net the person a boot or a jail as the
severity of the case.  Swearing in shouts should get an immediate shout
back saying that isnt allowed or a warn/rm_shout depending on the
severity and the knowledge of the person (ressies should know better than
newbies not to swear).
(2) harassment - Harassing someone for net.sex or direct cursing etc. are
a MAJOR offense.  If the situation arises that you are told somone is
being harassed, tell an admin if there is one on hand and tell the perosn
accused in a TELL something like 'I have been told you have been harassing
ppl - lets hope that Im informed wrong'  In the mean time, direct the 
person who claims to be harasses to the block and ignore flags - if the 
situation worsens there will be site banning involved.  It just wont be 
tolerated.
(3) Drugs - drugs are as bad as language and should be treated in the 
same basic fashion.
