This may seem stupid, but if you wish to speak a language other than 
english please do it in a room other than the main rooms.   It is unfair 
to leave others out of your conversatino because you are able to be 
harassing to others if no one understand what you are saying.   If you 
wish to talk to people in a language besides english  use a channel, a 
tell, a whisper, or any of the many other private forms of communication.

Again, the language rules here are more lax than most, and thank you for 
your cooperation.
