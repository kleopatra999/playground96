To COMPILE the binary.

Go to your src and type   
gcc -O ssort.c
mv a.out ../bin/spodsort


Thats it. From the bin directory, type 
updatespodlist

This will call asty's shell script to sort the spodlist without
causing grief and a long set of instructions.

To bring the new list online in the live version, simply use the
reload command.
