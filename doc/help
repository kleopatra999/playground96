:rules

This is a set of guidelines of expected behaviour on the program.

1. No ^Rdrug^N discussion - I don't think I need to tell you what a 
        "drug" is, do I?  (if I DO, then type ^Rhelp drugs^N)

2. No ^R^Kharassment^N. Don't be abusive. If you're abusive to someone,
        don't expect the SU's to give you any slack.
  
  -=> read ^Bhelp harass^N for more info on this one ...

2a.  By the way, attacking peoples personal beliefs on contriversial issues
  	such as abortion, religion, etc, is seriously frowned upon, and it
 	is also against the rules.

2b.  The decision on what is and is not "harassment" is up to the individual
	superuser. If they tell you to knock it off, knock it off!
	(if you want to argue 1st ammendment rights, read help first)

3. Speaking of language - the official language of this talker is
        English. Feel free to speak whatever you want in private 
        rooms. However, in the public discussions, we ask that you
        speak english.

4. Most people find all words typed in all CAPITAL letters annoying.
        For this reason, we ask that you keep capitalizations to a
        minimum. Realize that the program scans for capital letters
        and "symbols" in shouts, and automatically limits your ability
        to shout - so it's in your best interest to keep the caps to a
        minimum as well :) 
	
   Also note that excessive use of colors in shouts can result in having
	shoutting priveleges removed too.

5. NO MULTIPLE CHARACTERS - if we see that you have a multiple character,
        ALL characters will be nuked (^Rdeleted^N) with no notice.

6. Thats the basics.. One more, just to be clear. The job of interpreting 
	these rules is that of the superuser. Therefore, the decisions of 
	a superuser in interpreting these rules is beyond argument.

Simply put ....^RWE WILL NOT PUT UP WITH HARASSMENT OF ANY SORT.^N 

If we find that you or someone from your site is guilty of harassment
   of any sort ... we _will_ ban your entire site.  That includes any 
   Superusers, and/or Admin from your site as well.
   
   In other words - ^RNO EXCEPTIONS.^N 

   (and we're REALLY sure that the other people from your site would
    just LOVE you if you caused your site to be banned... and your site
    admins would just love to hear which of their users has been being 
    abusive...)

If YOU are the one being harassed, you can send the last 5 tells you
recieved to any superuser with the REPORTTO command (help reportto)

:0,general,newbie,help

        Easiest way to use "^Bhelp^N" is to go through the help pages -
        help 1, help 2, etc...

        help can be found also on various topics, and on specific 
        commands. If you think a help page might be "missing" then
        post mail to traP explaining what is needed :)

:14,|,pipe 
         A way of directing text to several different people.

          Format: <emote/shout/say/echo> <msg> | <user list>
            (see 'help ulist' for help on <user list>)

        Example     emote smiles at you. | alice,astyanax

        You will see : 
                You Emote : traP smiles at alice and astyanax.

        alice sees (as a personal message)
                traP smiles at you and astyanax.

        astyanax sees (as a personal message)
                traP smiles at alice and you.

        Everyone else in the room sees (as a room message) :
                traP smiles at alice and astyanax.

:say,',",`

SAY    - 'tells' everyone in the same room as you something.

format: say <something>

if <something> ends with a ! then it becomes an "exclaim"
if it ends in ? then it becomes an "ask"
if it ends in anything else, it's a "say"

eg:   say hi people!            traP exclaims 'hi people!'
      say where are you from?   traP asks 'where are you from?'
      say that's cool.          traP says 'that's cool.'

-=> SAY is _aliased_ to " ' `  
eg:     " hi         traP says 'hi'
        ' hello      traP says 'hello'

:think,~

THINK   - puts your thoughts into a "thought bubble" and tells it to everyone
          in the same room as you.

format: think <thought>

eg: think hope we dont crash...   traP thinks . o O ( hope we dont crash... )
    think ooooooooookay...        traP thinks . o O ( ooooooooookay... )

-=> THINK is aliased to ~
eg:   ~ this is easier =)         traP thinks . o O ( this is easier =) )

:emote,;,:

EMOTE   - this is the most "general" type of communication. It simply puts
          whatever you say after your name with no "extras" added on =)
          EMOTE tells the message to everyone in the room.

format: emote <action>

eg:  emote giggles            traP giggles
     emote blinks at you.     traP blinks at you.

-=> EMOTE is aliased to : and ;
eg:    ; runs away!           traP runs away!
       : laffs                traP laffs

Also note. If your "action" begins with a ' symbol, the program assumes you
           want to "squeeze" the line together... 
eg:    emote 'll be right back.     traP'll be right back.
       ; 'z computer is broken       traP'z computer is broken

:pemote,::,;;,:;,;:

PEMOTE   - just like EMOTE, except it puts 's at the end of your name.

format: pemote <possessive>

eg:    pemote dog is cool       trap's dog is cool
     
(if your name ends in s, then it does this..)

       pemote cat rules         chains' cat rules

-=> PEMOTE is aliased to :: :; ;: ;;  
eg:    ;; car is flooded again   traP's car is flooded again

:no_prs

NO_PRS    - toggles whether people can play paper rock scissors with you
	    (type help prs)

:no_propose, no_proposals

NO_PROPOSE - toggles whether or not you can be proposed to (only if unwed)

:whisper,=

WHISPER   - sends a private message to 1 or a group of people in the same
            room as you.
            (as opposed to tell, which sends the message regardless of what
             room the recipient is in)

format: whisper <player(s)> <message>

-=> WHISPER is aliased to =

You type                         You see                     
=alice hi                        You whisper 'hi' to alice

player(s) see                    rest of room sees nothing..
traP whispers 'hi' to you.       

:echo,+

ECHO     - sends a "semi-anonymous" message to everyone in the room.

Format: echo <msg>
-=> ECHO is aliased to +

you type  You see          People with seeecho off/on see    
+Boo!     You echo: Boo!   + Boo!               + [traP] Boo!
echo hi.  You echo: hi.    + hi.                + [traP] hi.

(the '+' symbol means that the text was an echo. whether the + is seen or
 not is controlled by the 'show' command)

:sing,)

SING     - sing something to everyone in the room
-=> SING is aliased to )

Format: sing <song>

eg: sing do re mi            traP sings o/~ do re mi o/~

:tell,>,.

TELL     - private communications. You can tell anything to anyone on the 
           program, and only you and the people you "tell" to will hear the
           message.
-=> tell is aliased to > and .

Format: tell <player(s)> <message> 

eg:   tell alice what's goin on? =)     traP tells you 'what's goin on? =)'

(see help chantalk for more info...)
:rt,*,rthink

RT       - short for 'REMOTE THINK' - it's just like think, except it goes 
           to a specific list of people instead of the room that you're in.

-=> RT is aliased to *

format: rt <player(s)> (thought>

*trap huh?             erland thinks . o O ( huh? )      (only trap sees it)

(see help chantalk for more info...)

:su,super,superuser

One of the most frequently asked questions here is
'how can I become an su?' Because of this, this help file has been
created to answer this question.

First off, the candidate must realize what the su position entails
(this does not mean that you must be an su elsewhere to become an su
 here, but rather that you learn what it means to be an su before you
 are actually granted the su privleges/responsibilities)

Being an SU does NOT mean that you can just sneeze, boot and frog at will
The admins here take these things very seriously. Such commands are to be
used only as a last resort for dealing with those who would cause chaos and
anarchy here. It is MUCH better, both for the su, and for the player, to
be able to resolve an issue without having to resort to the threat or use
of the su commands. People who are able to "explain" that 'such behavior
is frowned upon, and should not be continued' are much prefered to the 
people whos automatic answer to any situation is to boot or sneeze.

Being an SU means, quite frankly, that you have to put up with whatever
others on the talker dish out. This ranges from the Admins and their        
quirks and insanity (all admins are insane. Don't let anyone tell you
differently) to residents who hate your guts because of jealousy of your
position, to newbies asking the silliest questions imaginable, like "how
do i talk?" and "what is a title?"      

As an SU, part of your job is teacher. Everyone on the program will come to
you first with any questions they have, from simple commands like seeecho   
and earmuffs, to complex commands (like the dreaded room edit commands) to
non-talker related questions (like 'how do I ftp' or 'how do I finger a
site' or even 'what is the command to compile a program in c++?')

Note that, while you are expected to handle the simple and complex talker
commands, a knowledge of the non-talker related stuff, while helpful, will
not affect your chances of getting a position as an su here. But, you 
should know who on the talker (staff or otherwise) CAN answer such 
questions, and be able to direct the questions you cannot answer to the
appropriate person. 

You should be familiar with all the resident commands, and be able to 
explain the quickly and clearly to others. You can't let frustration
show when a newbie says 'i don't get it' or 'that's not what i meant.'
I can guarantee from experience that you'll have people who simply have
no business using a computer, who somehow stumble on the 'telnet' command,
asking you questions and then never understanding the answer. You just have
to wear a fake smile and try again.

You'll have to deal with people who are just really stupid, who all they
want to do is cause troubles for everyone else, and especially you. People
will hate your guts, and you'll just have to deal with it with your
therapist (you DO have a therapist, dont you?)

You'll have to be an example to the other users, never bending the rules
yourself, and remember that, as long as you are a su here, you represent
the entire talker with every action you take. 

However... if you think you can handle it, then that's great. Here's some
advice on how to become one, from someone who's been there. Never harass the 
admins .. they have to deal with this 'can i be an su' question more times 
in the day than they can count, and the last thing they wanna hear is another
variation of that question. Try never to break the rules. Be friendly to 
other users, su's and newbies alike. (being a friendly person is a big plus)
Always be helpful. But don't stress too much about being helpful... you'll
just look like a kiss-up.

If you REALLY REALLY have an interest in being an su here, however, I 
suggest you send an email to (talker@s195_13.resnet.ucla.edu) telling the 
admins why you think you'd make a good su here.

Spod (noun) (feminine:Spodess) (plural individual: Spodz) (Neuter: Spodo) -
   A sad, sometimes fluffy, sometimes not so fluffy, computer nerd.
   A spod is easily distinguished by the following characteristics:

1. Extraordinarily long login times to talkers and/or Muds
2. Knows a dangerous amount of info about the internet - more than any
   person should.
3. Often known to break into computer labs after hours just to telnet.
4. Sometimes name their favorite terminals
5. Often witness beautiful sunrises and/or sunsets... from a computer
   terminal.
6. Spod Eyes syndrome - Eyes feel as if they will budge after long hours
   spent at a terminal.

                  he?)
 Spoddy (adj)   - Fitting the behavioral patterns of a spod. (traP, you
                  spoddy spoon!)

:spod-classes,spod.classes,spod_classes,spodclasses,spodclass
-> How many pests would a pestispod pest if a pestispod could spod pests? <-

There are 15 basic subdivisions of the Spod class: These include -

Antispod    - A spod who enjoys tricking and hurting newbies. These spods
              are very dangerous to newbies.
Minispod    - These spods often sit idle for minutes and hours at a time,
              often because they are also multispods.
Multispod   - Spods who can and do multi-task so they can log on to several
              talkers and muds simultaneously
Superspod   - Spods who are also superusers (or equivalent)
Pestispod   - Spods who always ask "Can I be an SU?" As this class is very
              large and diverse, the pestispod has several classical
              subdivisions of it's own.
    Grabypestispod  - Spods who try to become an su by making a big deal
                      about bringing new people into the talker.
    Helpypestispod  - Spods who make a big deal about helping newbies (some
                      will only be "helpful" if an admin is in the room!)
    Assitipestispod - Spod who makes a big deal about helping the admin
                      (giving ideas, volunteering to make system rooms, etc.)

Megaspod    - Spods who outspod spods :) To be a true megaspod is the
              ultimate complement, and the ultimate insult :)
Hermospod   - Hermospods spend an inordinate amount of time (over 70%) of
              their time in their own home room.
Publispod   - Publispods spend 70% or more of their time in public (usually
              the main) rooms
Scitzospod  - Special class of spods. Scitzospods usually have multiple
              characters (usually on different talkers... see help rules if
              you're thinking about using different names on the same talker)
Spatulaspod - (derived from the 'your.name' is you, you spoon! message).
              Spatulaspods are either absent-minded, or just stooopid.
Transvispod - These are the crossgender spods : male pretending to be female
              & vice versa is not the only form, this can be used in jest
              with people who set their genders to plural or "it"
Vampispod   - Spods who prefer to do their spoding when the sun is down.
Solarspod   - Spods who do their spodding during daylight hours.
Adminospod  - All admins are spods. If they weren't they wouldn't set up a
              talker, would they? :-)
Anonyispod  - A spod who is a member of Spodders Anonymous.

Most spods belong to more than one of these classes: for example

Someone exclaims 'Trap, you lousy MegaMultiSuperPubliVampiSpatulaspod!'

:ressie,residency
One of the more common questions we get is "What does it mean to be a 
resident?" There are many advantages to gaining residency, among them :
   
   You dont have to go through all those annoying validation procedures every
      time you enter the program.
   You get to have your own list, and with that comes friends lists, informs
      (notify you when someone connects to the program) and the like.
   And most importantly, you get a room of your own!!  You can make your 
      own description for it and have all your friends over for a chat (and
      keep annoying gits out of it as well).

Gaining residency is simple.  Just look around for the friendly 
neighborhood SU (or type lsu if you dont see any in the room youre in) 
and tell <su's name> you would like to become a resident.  Generally 
there are two requirements : 1. A valid email address and 2. Agreement to 
follow help rules (type help rules to see them).  Thats all there is to 
it :)  Enjoy your newgound residency :)

=astyanax (4/6/95)

:decap

DECAP <user>

removes / grants the ability to use upper case letters -- use this to force
people who constantly insist on all caps to use all lower_case letters.

Affects all says, shouts, echos, sings, tells, remotes, and gossip channel.

by traP on 10/6/95

:whois

Format:   whois <player>

If you have enough login time, or you get permission from an admin, you
may have a "whois" page here. The only limits are that the page cannot violate
any rules, and it must be smaller than 20 lines (the 20 line limit may be
negotiable under special circumstances)

:idling,truespod

From now on, when you idle for a sufficient amount of time, the program
will catch this, and will deduct time from your total login time. This means
that, now, everyone has two "total login" amounts.. total login (which includes
idling) and truespod, which penalizes idlers, and is therefore a more
accurate measurment of how big a spod you are.

Also, a friendly warning: people who get kicked off by the program for idling
for an hour -- you may notice your adjusted spod time plummet...

:suicide

SUICIDE will DELETE your character from this program. To confirm your
desire to die, you must enter your password to prove you are who you
are. You must also give a reason for ending your life.

If you need any help with this, just ask an su.

:15,chan,ch,ce,ct,cp,cs,cwho,ch_hi,lci

Playground now has dynamically allocated resident channels that you can access
use and manipulate with the following commands

ch      - channel say          		ct - channel think
ce	- channel emote			cp - channel pemote
cs 	- channel sing			

chan create (name)       -- create a new channel with the name of (name)
chan join (#)            -- join an existing channel
chan list (or lsc)       -- list all active channels (see help lsc)
chan join (#)            -- join an active channel
chan who (#) (or cwho #) -- list people on a given channel
chan quit (#)            -- leave a channel
chan nograb              -- stop channel ops from grabbing you on their channel
chan hitell (or ch_hi)   -- toggle channel hitells

see help chanop for operator commands.
see help chanrules for channel rules
see help chantalk for more on how to talk on channels

:chanop

These added commands work for channel operators only.

chan invite (player)   -- invite a player to join your channel
chan uninvite (player) -- revoke an invitation to join a channel 
chan nuke              -- destroy your own channel
chan xfer (player)     -- transfer the operator powers to player
		    	  (a channel can only have ONE operator)
chan grab (player)     -- grab a player onto your channel
chan topic (topic)     -- set the channel topic
chan boot (player)     -- kick someone off your channel
chan nonewbies         -- ban/allow newbies from the channel
chan nosing            -- ban/allow singing on the channel
chan private           -- ban/allow others to join the channel
		 	  (you can still grab people onto a private channel)

If you have any problems, ask an su. if you find bugs, log with BUG command

:c-rules,chanrules

1. You cannot be an operator on more than one channel
2. No channel can have more than one operator
3. Any channel that is unused for 10 minutes is destroyed.
4. Any channel that has less than 3 people may be destroyed.
5. If you set a vulgar channel name or topic, the staff will destroy
    your channel.
6. What goes on on a channel itself is considered private. If you are 
    offended by whats happening on a channel, leave.

Thats about it. Oh, there is a maximum of 30 channels (0 to 29)

If you have any problems, ask an su. if you find bugs, log with BUG command
thanx.                         --traP

:chantalk

This applies to all the channel talk commands (ch, ce, cp, ct, and cs)

if you are on only one channel:

	Simply use the correct channel command and your message. The
	message will be directed to the correct channel automatically.

If you are on more than one channel:

	The first word of your message must be the number of the channel
	you want the message to go to.
	
	If you forget, it will attempt to send your message to channel 0
	
Also. If you are more used to "multis", there is support for that type of
useage.. simply use the tell, remote, etc commands, and tell the # of the 
channel -- your tell will go to the channel you request.

Note that if you use this option, that when you're only on one channel you 
must still use the number of the channel.

:lsc

LSC -- lists active channels

if the Channel ID has a star after it, you cannot join that channel.
if there is a + sign, you're already on the channel.
If there is nothing, then you are allowed to join.

:propose,accept,reject,cancel

PROPOSE (player)   -- ask another person to marry you.
ACCEPT (player)    -- agree to marry another person.
REJECT (player)    -- refuse to marry the person.
CANCEL		   -- This command will cancel your net engagement.

If you are net.engaged, it will appear on your "x"

:anul

ANUL (player) -- clears all marital data. Gives no messages. Use with discresion

:nofriend

NOFRIEND (player) (on/off) -- toggles whether or not someone can send tells 
			      to your friends.

:blocklist

BLOCKLIST (on/off)   -- Toggles if your friends can send messages to all your
			 friends or not.

:to,ro,po,so,eo,rto,yo

These commands are for telling to other peoples friends
(see HELP FRIENDTELL for more info) 

	TO <player> <msg>       -- Tell to other players friends
	RO <player> <msg>       -- remote to other players friends
	PO <player> <msg>       -- premote to other players friends
	SO <player> <msg>       -- sing to other players friends

	YO <player> <msg>       -- yell to other players friends
	RTO <player> <msg>      -- think to other players friends

:friendtell

Now you can send tells to the friends of your friends.

Here's an example.. 

A and B are friends of each other.

A types:

	to B hi

All of B's friends (including A) sees

	B tells A's friends 'hi'

A sees

	B tells your friends 'hi'

A can stop B from doing this with NOFRIEND and BLOCKLIST (see the help files
	for these commands)

:flirt

FLIRT      -- changes your net status from bachelor to net.flirt and back.

		Being engaged or married overrides this setting.

:blockfmail

BLOCKFMAIL    -- Blocks all friend mail.

:xref

XREF <name> -- check for similar names in saved files..

	The use for this is to check if a newbie wants to ressie a name that
	might be too similar to a name already taken by someone else.

	If it is too close, just politely ask the newbie to pick a new name..
	99 times out of 100, they will pick a new name and you can rename them
	and ressie them then.

:toggle_chan

Switches you from normal channel commands [su se st ss] to 
the "clanland" channel commands [s' s; s~ s(]

:hometown

HOMETOWN (place you're from)

	Sets your hometown on your "x" file

:homeview,mindseye

HOMEVIEW / MINDSEYE  -- lets you see who's in a room you own.

:tf,tinyfugue

TINYFUGUE (tf) is a Telnet "client" -- and is the BEST client in existance
today. You can get it via ANONYMOUS FTP from magic.infomagic.com, or from
ftp.tcp.com      

:hack,hacking

Hacking is defined on the Playground as anyone who tries to login as 
someone else. You may have one, and ONLY one, saved resident character
on playground. You cannot "borrow" someone elses account, with, or without
their concent.

Any person who attempts to hack the Playground, whether the talker account
or any residents account, will be COMPLETELY site banned - meaning that 
no one from your domain (for most of you, this means your entire school
or your entire service provider) will ever be allowed to logon to the
Playground again. In addition, if we know what account you used to hack
from, we WILL report this information to your system administrator, and
ask that your internet accounts be permenantly removed.

Simply put, we will not tolerate illegal access attempts, and we will take
any and all actions that we can to stop them from occuring.

				-traP

:spam,spamming,piping

Spam/Spamming

      Spamming and/or piping is repeating the same thing over and over,
   otherwise known as "piping" text into the buffer and then filling
   a person's screen rapidly.  This is very impolite and is grounds for
   being booted, yoyoed, jailed, sneezed, etc... if the spamming party 
   does not cease.


:ad,ads,advert,advertize,advertizing

Advertizing other talkers here:

	*Don't*

	This is an example of "acceptable" advertizing here:
		Ask an admin to list you on help talkers.
		do a friend tell.
		
	Everything else is not appreciated, and will be handled severely. This
	is because we are a new talker ourselves, and don't appreciate being
	"raided" by other talkers.

Advertizing our talker on other talkers:
	
	Do tell your friends about this place.
	Do ask to have us listed in a help talkers 

	Don't shout addresses. Its rude.
	Don't post news without explicit admin permission.

Advertizing our talker elsewhere on the internet:

	Newsgroups: Try and stick to "appropriate" groups
	Gopher/WWW: DO try and get us listed on gophers and WWW pages 
			that link to talkers
		(if you want to link it to your home page, do this:)

	 	<A HREF = "telnet://site.ext:port/"> Link to PG </A>	

	Email: 	Mail your friends, not random people ;)
	Other:  your own best judgement, based on these guidelines.

	-- Written by traP on 18/11/95	

:16,color,syscolor,colorize,fingerpaint,colour,syscolour,colourize

Playground now offers ^Ccolor^N. 

To use this, you should be on a terminal that supports ansi color codes. 
More help on getting color to work may be made available later.

But for now, try it by typing ^Hfingerpaint^N

If you see colors, then you will be able to use and view colors. Even if some
colors don't seem to work, others may, and you may want to activate it, even 
if its only for a few shades.

Color related commands:

COLOR 	- activate ^Hstandard color mode^N -- you will see the colors others
	  create in their rooms, in help files, in descriptions, practically
	  everywhere.

SYSCOLOR - This enables ^CActive Color Mode^N -- where you can set the colors
	   of certain types of input by using the COLORIZE command. So your
	   tells can be white while your shouts are dark blue and your 
	   friend tells scream in blinking text.

COLORIZE - Without an argument, it will show you your current system colors.
	   With arguments, it will change your color settings for one type of
	   command.

Good luck, and any questions should be relayed to traP. 

:17,aliases,define,undefine,lsa

Playground now supports aliases. An alias is a substitute for a longer  
set of commands.. for example...

define idin idle indiefan

This creates a "pseudo-command" called idin. If i type idin, I will see how 
long indiefan has been idle.

PG ->idin
indieFan has just hit return.
PG ->

You can also list your aliases.

PG ->lsa
You are using 1 out of 10 maximum aliases.

idin		= idle indiefan
PG ->

Also, it is easy to remove an alias you no longer need.

PG ->undefine idin
Alias deleted...
PG ->lsa
You are not using any of your 10 aliases.
PG ->

See help advanced for more info on what can be done with aliases.

:advanced,%

These "variables" can be inserted into an alias you create.

%0          - This means to list all arguments and insert here.

e.g.        define sillysay emote sez -=> %0 <=-
	    sillysay red doofus
	    sillysay bouncey bouncey bouncey :-P
	    sillysay .

%1  %2      - These mean to take this word in the list of arguments.

e.g.        define bop remote %1 bops you with a %2
	    bop traP spoon 
	    (you bop traP with a spoon)

            define flip emote tackles %2 and %1.
	    flip traP Nogard   
	    (you tackle nogard and trap)

%-1   %-2   This is a special case. You can list all argunments AFTER the first,
		second, etc, word.

	    define tickle remote %1 tickles you all until %-1.
	    tickle friends the end of the day.
	    (you tickle your friends until the end of the day)
	    
            define telltwo tell %1,%2 %-2
	    telltwo traP nogard hello silly coders.
	    (you tell traP and nogard 'hello silly coders')

%;	    This is a very special case. This can be used to perform multiple
	    commands with one alias. The %; seperates the commands from each 
	    other.

	    define getinfo x me%;lsu%;swho%;qwho

	    When you type getinfo, you will x yourself, do an lsu, a swho, and 
	      a qwho in that order.

%{@@}	    This is the most recent addition. You can insert random phrases
		into your aliases.. Pay careful attention to the format.

	    define cast_spell emote chants as %{red@green@blue} smoke swirls.

		This will choose a random word (red, green, or blue) and use
		that in the phrase.

	    This is not allowed.

		define random_arg say %{1@2@3}
		You would randomly say the numbers rather than using that word.

	    However, this may change in the future.

	
One word of warning. If you abuse aliases they will be removed from you.

If an alias you write crashes the program, don't use the alias again. Also, 
	report it to traP so he can fix the bug.

And, be careful about doing stuff like this...

	define oy say oy %1, that hurt.

	PG ->oy

	Funny things may happen when you forget an argument..

:etrace

trace an email address against a the reslist.

:y

:deflogon,deflogoff,defrecon,logon,logoff,recon

These are special aliases you can define for what happens just before you 
logon, reconnect, or logoff -- do NOT give these aliases arguments, because 
they will not be sent any arguments by the program.

DEFLOGON   -- change the script before you logon
DEFLOGOFF  -- change the script after you logoff
DEFRECON   -- change the script after a reconnection.

:library,liblist,libexam,libcopy

Playground now has a modest library of useful and/or fun aliases that you
may freely copy into your own private alias list.

liblist -- lists all aliases currently in the library

libexam <alias> -- get more info on a specific alias.

libcopy <alias> [<your name for it>]  -- copy a library alias into your 
				alias list. You may optionally use a different
				name for the alias, or you can use the same name
				as the library version.

We are looking to add a lot more to our small library. Please send your ideas
and/or favorite aliases by internal mail to the admin

:basics

   These are the 10 most important commands to know about on Playground.

' <what you want to say>   -- talk to everyone in the room   (help say)

; <what you want to do>    -- do an action to everyone in the room (help emote)

> <someones name> <what you want to tell them> 
			   -- talk privately to someone   (help tell)

join <someone>             -- go to someone elses room    (help join)

leave                      -- go to the main room         (help leave)

commands <section>         -- see what stuff you can do   (help commands)

lsu                        -- see who the super users who are on are

who                        -- see who everyone on the program is

x <someone>                -- get info about someone else on the program

f <someone>                -- get info about any user of the program

(10 commands, and you won't look like a total moron.. but you should learn
 the others too, if you want to be a REAL user of the playground)

:history

See the last 8 tells, remotes, rsings, and other private messages you recieved.

** This command was given to us courtesy of Jyld from Resort **
:reportto,rpt

this sends a copy of the last 8 tells you recieved to the superuser of your
choice..  

This is a tool to combat harassment -- the info is taken from your history 
buffer, and will only be sent by you: the superusers and admins cannot see
this info unless you specifically give it to them.  

If you have any questions about this, ask the admins

** This command was given to us courtesy of Jyld from Resort **

:of,ox

of -- the "old" finger command
ox -- the "old" examine command

:favorite,favourite

FAVORITE allows you to set some stuff in your new examine file --

FAVORITE LIST -- list what you set for your favorites.

FAVORITE <#> BLANK -- delete a favorite

FAVORITE <#> <topic> <answer> -- set or change a favorite.

the first two formats should be easy, the third however requires some 
explanation:

here are some examples, and the results you'll get with them...

favorite 1 cereal cheerios
You set your favorite cereal to be: cheerios.
(in examine file)
Favorite cereal       : cheerios.

favorite 2 girls name susan
You set your favorite girls to be: name susan      
(the problem here is that a topic can only be one word)

favorite 3 star
You set your favorite star to be: .
(you gotta give an answer, but the program isn't smart enough yet to 
  realize this yet)

favorite Antidisestablismentarian BoB
You set your favorite Antidisestab to be: BoB
(The topic can only be 12 letters long max, in order to fit)

:first

It always happens. Someone breaks the rules, then complains when they get in
  trouble that the punishment is a ^Hviolation of their first ammendment rights^N.

So, for your enjoyment, (or lack thereof) -- here IS the first ammendment to
  the constitution of the united states:

        ^HCongress^N shall make no law respecting an establishment of
        religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
        abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right
        of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the
        Government for a redress of grievances.

Nowhere, not one word at all, refers to Playground.  When you agreed to the
disclaimer, you agreed to follow our rules. Playground is not the Congress. 
It is not an agency of the US Government. You have full rights as a citizen
to have whatever opinion you want, but as the owner of the Playground, I
have the rights to say what does and does not go in ^Kmy^N home.

In other words - if you feel like your right to be offensive and annoying is
being violated, ^Ktough shit^N. I have the right, as the owner of the playground,
to set the rules. The rules are extremely liberal, all I ask is that you do not
harass people, and that you do not violate the very basic minimum of the rules
of nettique. The rules are made for the benifit of the community, not because
I want to push some agenda or restrict your rights.

Remember -- your right to swing your fists around ends at the tip of my nose.

To those of you who do follow the rules, I thank you, and hope that you 
  continue to enjoy the program.

:disclaim

DISCLAIM <player>

Makes a person have to agree to the disclaimer again -- useful for email
registrations -- log em in, ressie em, set their email & a temp password, 
then disclaim them -- so that they'll have to agree to the disclaimer to
use the program.

:ckban

CKBAN <IP address>

	Check if a site is banned, and why, and to what extent.

	Here are some examples of its use..

->ckban 0.0.0.0
Site is totally banned.
Banned by: traP
Reason: # Constant harassment of other users.
->ckban 255.255.255.0
Site is banned to new users.
Banned by: vallie
Reason: # people keep shoutting addresses to other talkers
->ckban 128.58.99.69
That site doesn't appear to be banned.....

NOTES:
1) you can't use * wildcards -- sorry, but I haven't implemented that.
2) if a site is banned twice, only the first listing will show up.
   This is a bug in the implementation, and will be fixed soon.
3) You can't scan name addresses.. i.e. ckban s195_13.resnet.ucla.edu
   This is because all bans are stored internally as IP's -- eventually,
   it may be possible to scan a name address -- but not yet.

Any ?'s -- ask an admin
 
:prs,game,games

You can now play paper-rock-scissors against a friend.. here's an example
game between traP and astyanax:

(traP types)
prs astyanax paper             -- Play prs against astyanax, and pick paper

(astyanax sees)
traP wants to play paper-rock-scissors with you.

(astyanax decides to play)
prs trap paper

(both trap and astyanax see)
You tied!!

(if astyanax decided not to play against trap, he could have typed)
prs clear

oooooooooooo Rules ooooooooooooooooo
1. You can only play against one person at a time.
2. Paper beats Rock, Rock beats Scissors, scissors beats paper.

----------- tips -------------------
1. If you get errors that you're "not playing against that person"
	then use "prs clear" to reset your game status
2. If you find a bug, report it with the bug command

:room_edit,room-edit,rooms_edit,rooms-edit

You want to decorate your room?  Then, read this carefully and make sure 
you _understand_ it before you start!

Naming your room:
	-To name your room: type room name <name you want>
		-Example: room name in the forest.
			-Now, when people type where, they will see '<name>
			 is in the forest.'
		-Tip: you need to use the word "in" before the name of your
		 room.  Otherwise, it will look like '<name> the forest.'

Room identification (different from room name):
	-To give your room an id: type room id <name>
		-Example: room id forest
		-This changes the id from <name>.room1 to <name>.forest
	-This is a name that allows people to go to your room from any other.

Setting an enter message:
	-To set an enter message: type room entermsg <msg>
		-Example: room entermsg enters the forest.
			-When someone enters that room, it will show up as
			 '<name> enters the forest.'

Decorating (editing) your room:
Step 1: Getting into the editor to decorate your room.
 	-type: room edit
	-If this is done correctly, you will see the description of your
	 room show up as:
		A bare room belonging to (your name).
		Isn't it time to write a description?


Step 2A: Deleting the entire room description with one command.
	-If you want to just delete the entire room that you currently have,
	 type: .wipe (making sure the period is in there.)
		-This is only if you want to start from scratch.  You will
 		 lose everything that you currently have!  This can be used
		 at any time. (If yo do this you can skip step 2B)

Step 2B: Deleting the description already there.
	-Part A: You need to move back two lines within the editor.
		-type: .- (make sure you put the period in there, or it
		 will be assumed that the - is part of your room design)
		-Do this two times.  Each time you move back a line
		 the editor will show you what line you have moved
		 to.

	-Part B: Now, you need to delete the line.
		-type: .del (again, make sure the period is in there.)
			-This will delete the line that you are currently on.
			-The editor will not show you what line gets deleted
			 however, so make sure you know exactly where you are.
			-To make sure you know where you are, play with the
			 .- and .+ functions.  (.+ will move you forward one
			 line.)

	-Parts A and B are also ways of making any corrections to a specific
	 line in your description.

Step 3: Designing your room.
	-Type whatever you want your description or design to be at the +
	 (prompt).
	-After you hit return, the line you have just typed will appear again.
	-Please be aware, if you are doing a design, that the prompt does not
	 take up an actual space in the design.  (You will learn what I mean
	 when you hit return, as everything will be shifted over one space.)
	-This editor is a line by line editor.
		-This means that you need to hit return when you get to the
	 	 end of a line (80 characters) in order to make sure that it  
		 turns out the way you want it to.  The editor will continue 
		 each line if you do not hit return, and the design or 
		 description may not turn out the way you had planned.
	-One tip, especially for those doing designs, is to draw what you want
	 on graph paper.  This will help you with your spacing.

Step 4: Saving your room.
	-type: .end (Make sure that the period is in there.)
		-This will QUIT out of the editor, and SAVE all changes that
		 have been made by you.

Notes and Tips:
	-_Quitting Without Saving_
		-If you are unsatisfied with the room you've created, and
		 DON'T want to save the changes (and don't want to work on
		 your room anymore due to frustration):
			-type: .quit (Make sure the period is in there.)

	-If you are using Tiny Fugue:
		-Leave a space between the prompt (+) and slash (/), if that
		 is the first character in the line.
		-Also, be aware that the above means that you will have to
		 shift the entire design over one space.  Not just the line
		 with a slash at the beginning.

:gag,ungag,blank_gags,gwho

GAG <player>    -- ignore a player without taking up a list space
UNGAG <player>  -- undo a gag
GWHO            -- list everyone you've gagged
BLANK_GAGS      -- reset your gaglist


gags work just like ignores, except that they don't take up a spot on
your list.. the price for this, however, is when you (or they) quit the
program, they get ungagged, because gags aren't saved.  However, gags are
useful to protect yourself against harassment from newbies, and if you are
a newbie, from harassment in general.

They also tend to send a message of "geez, chill out" -- people generally
don't like to be gagged, and may take the hint when a few people gag them.

:drugs,drug,pot,marijuana,cocaine,heroin,alcohol,caffeine,illegal

	A DRUG is defined, for the purpose of the Playground rules,
as ANY substance that is illegal to either make, use, buy, sell, or
possess in the United States of America, without the specific prescription
of a Doctor of Medicine.  This includes substances such as cocaine, 
marijuana, heroin, PCP, LSD, as well as many others.  Discussion of 
these items, even mentioning them, in any tell, say, shout, sing, mail, 
news, or any other sort of communication at all is completely illegal 
on the playground.  The continued existance of the Playground comes 
before your "right" to free speech (incidently, if you haven't yet 
read it, read "help first")

	The following are technically drugs, but are not illegal to 
discuss, because their posession, use, purchace and selling are not
illegal: caffeine, nicotine, aspirin, etc.

	Alcohol and any alcohol containing substances are in a special
intermediate category. Discussion, mentioning of them, etc, is LEGAL,
however EXCESSIVE discussion of alcohol will not be tolerated. The
decision as to what is and is not "excessive" is up to the individual
superuser.

	These rules exist so that the Playground can continue to exist
in the face of the drug paranoia that prevails in most of America.
Sorry, but thats just the way it is. As I said before, the continued 
existance of the Playground comes before anything else.

		~traP

:items,item,obj,object,objects
	
	Items are dynamic objects that can be created, destroyed,
	bought, sold, and used.

	For more info on items, consult the individual files for
	each command

:all_delete

	Deletes ALL lso items.

	DON'T use this unless you ABSOLUTELY have to.

	Its hard coded to only allow me (traP) or dabot to do it.

	If you HAVE to do it, make dabot admin, and have him do it
	by remote control.

	This command will NOT restore money for purchased items, so
	expect irate ressies if you use it.

:blank_items

	This command will make all your items vanish. It will NOT
	give you the money that would have otherwise been given for
	selling the items.

	Use this command only if your inventory is totally screwed up.

:bop

	Bop a person with your WEILDed item.

	Format: bop <person>

	i.e.    bop traP
		
	if <person> is in the same room as you, the room will see you bop
	the sad spod.

	If the item has a special effect associated with it, that effect
	MIGHT be bestowed on the victim .. heh heh heh

:buy

	BUY an item from the LSO list

	format: buy <object>

	i.e.   buy spork

	You can only buy an item if you have enough PENNIES to buy it.

:builder 

	Make someone a builder: same format as minister

:create,setbit,setval,delete

	** These commands are available only to BUILDERS **

	CREATE <item name> <item description>
	SETBIT <item name> <flag>

	DELETE <item>
	
	type HELP BITS for the possible arguments to setbit
	type help creation and item deletion for more information

:bits
	SETBIT flags:

	food	-- make something edible
	drink	-- make something drinkable
	wear	-- make something wearable	
	weild	-- make something weildable	
	bag	-- make something openable (open not yet implemented)
	toy	-- allow people to PLAY with item 
	unique	-- Only allow people to own ONE of these at a time

:creation

	SO you want to create an item

	First, you have to be a builder

	If you are.. 

		Decide what you want to build. Lets say, I 
		decide to create a can of spam.  Since spam 
		can (technically) be eaten, I'll make it a 
		food item.  Also, since spam is such a part
		of internet culture, I'll make it cheap

	I type (in this order)

	create Spam A can of rubbery mystery meat

	setbit spam food

	setval spam 25

	This makes spam, at a cost of 25 pennies, available as an
	edible item.

	*** NOTE ***

	if spam already exists, then it will fail to create spam.

	After you SETVAL an item, you can no longer edit it, so 
	make sure your SETBIT stuff is done FIRST.

	Item names and descriptions cannot be too long

	Item names cannot start with $, -, +, or a number

:deletion

	To delete an old item, simply delete it with the delete command.

	Anyone who still owns one of them will have their item vanish,
	but will recieve a full refund for that item.

:eat

	EAT <item>

	Note: 	some items cannot be eaten
		some items do special things when eaten
		EVERYONE in the room will see you try to eat the item
		Once an item is eaten it is gone, and you do not get
			a refund for the cost of the item.

:give

	GIVE <money> <player> <amount> -- to give someone money
	GIVE <item> <player>	       -- to give someone an item

	NOTE: 	you cannot give items or pennies to newbies	
		you cannot give items or pennies to people who are
			blocking charity (see nogift)

:nogift

	This is a toggle that determines whether or not people can 
	give you stuff. Default is OFF (people can give you things)

:i,inv,inventory

	This command allows you to view what you're carrying.

	The entries look like this:

	[item id] (special flags) #pennies item_name -- item_description	
	
	Also can see how many pennies you have::
	[-1  ] ##### pennies -- dirty copper coin

:ix

	ix <item>

	examine an item

:lsb,list_builders

	lsb -- list all builders online

	BUILDERS can create and destroy objects, and are chosen carefully
	by the admins.

:lso,list_obj,list_objects

	lso -- list all available items

	Arguments:
		!(other args)  -- list items, but ignore desc line
		$-<amount>     -- items that cost LESS than <amount>
		$+<amount>     -- items that cost MORE than <amount>
		(any letter)   -- items whose name starts with the letter
		*	       -- ALL items
		+<bit>         -- all items with a given bit
		-<bit>	       -- all items except those with a given bit

	Bits at the end are fWBwTDU for:
		food, wear, bag, weild, toy, drink, unique

	i.e.
		lso !$+500    -- list all items costing more than 500, 
				 and block descriptions

:sell

	SELL an item you don't need anymore

	You get the full value of the item in pennies in return

_System Messages_

These messsages include your logon, logoff, enter, and exit messages.

                         !!!!! Drug warning !!!!!

^RRAPISTS^N SLIPPING VICTIMS MODERN-DAY MICKEYS
CHEAP PILL BLOTS OUT MEMORY OF ^RCRIMES^N

MIAMI-Imagine all the fears of parents whose daughters have hit
dating age packed into one white pill the size of a dime.
It may be the mightiest Mickey Finn ever concocted.
And it is not the fiction of Sam Spade novels and Humphrey Bogart
movies.

These days, it costs about $3 at the high school water fountain.  It
is colorless, odorless and quickly dissolves in a can of Diet Coke.
In about 10 minutes, it creates a drunk-like effect that lasts eight
hours.  It enhances the effects of alcohol, causing loss of inhibition,
extreme sleepiness, relaxation and - perhaps worst of all for its victims
- amnesia.

The pill is made of a drug called Rohypnol (pronounced ro-hip-nol).
Your kids know them as "roofies."

  And police are concerned - particularly about roofie rape.

In Broward County, Fla., 10 men have been arrested on roofie-rape
charges in the past year.  The most recent came Feb. 1, when two brothers
and a friend were charged with repeatedly raping a 15-year-old girl after
they secretly put a roofie in her soft drink. A 26-year-old Broward County
man who pleaded guilty to roofie rape in a 1995 case - Mark Anthony Perez
of Plantation - told authorities he used it to rape as many as 40 women.
The problem has not been as prevalent in Dade County, where police
departments reported a handful of suspected sexual assaults related
to roofies in the past six months.

A 17-year-old Coral Springs girl raped Jan. 7, 1996 while she was
under the influence of roofies lost 10 hours between having dinner with
friends and waking up in a strange hotel bed.  Police are investigating a
29-year-old suspect who was at the dinner.

"Her panties were around her ankles and a condom next to her,"  said
the girl's mother.  "My daughter didn't know this guy.  She doesn't
emember a thing.  This man is a rapist and he's going around doing this
to other women," she said.  "I want people to know how dangerous this is."

"It's a big, big deal out there right now," said Bonnie Lashbrook, a
student peer counselor at Cooper City High School.  "Parents of teen-age
girls should be scared."

College officials also note a concern on college campuses.  Reported
sexual assault have increased and may be linked to Rohypnol.  Officials
estimate that this may just be the tip of the iceberg.  Since, the
victims suffer amnesia many women may have no idea that have been raped.

Rohypnol is a potent and hypnotic sedative used in some countries to
put out surgery patients.  They are prescribed as sleeping pills in
about 80 countries, but not the United States.  The emergence of the
once-obscure sedative has thrown police agencies for a loop.  Florida law
officers have seized tens of thousands of the pills in the past year.
Rohypnol is also easily available from Mexico and parts of Europe.
In one raid, the pills were packaged in vitamin bottles and labeled
in Spanish.  They were shipped from Colombia and distributed by two
suspects, said sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal.
It has proliferated to such a point that the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have
joined forces with police to have Rohypnol's status as an illegal drug
enhanced to make penalties equal to cocaine and heroin.

"It's just that we have a chance in law enforcement to get ahead of
this thing before it gets too out of control," said Cooper City police
Capt. Jim Harn, whose agency is investigating several roofie-rape cases.

The incident involving the 15-year-old from Cooper City happened in
June at a Sweet 16 party at the Merrimac Hotel on Fort Lauderdale Beach.
Charged with her rape are brothers Sidney Harmon, 19, and Scott Harmon,
17, of Pembroke Pines, and Moises Ventura, 18, of Miramar.  The Harmons'
mother has said her sons are innocent.  The Ventura family has declined
comment.  According to friends, Scott and Moises were inseparable friends
who like to start fights and cause trouble.  Sidney, who aspires to be a
paramedic, is a quiet, sensitive boy, friends say.

Erica Verriotto, 17, said she was good friends with all three boys
for over several.  "Scott was kind of a troublemaker sometimes, you
know?" she said.  "Nothing really serious.  He used to like, start fights.
You know, yell at people who cut him off in traffic and stuff." "But
Sid, no way," she said.  "trust Sid no matter what."

Cooper City detectives say several other girls have come forward
with similar stories about the group of boys, but no charges have yet
been filed.

"A lot of times the guys don't think they've done anything wrong,"
said Cooper City police Det. Kregg Lupo.  "This is not a rape in their
eyes They think if the girl is not awake or alert enough to say, `No,'
it's not rape."

Police say they were able to arrest the Harmons and Ventura
primarily because the rapes happened while the victim's best friend
watched - an eyewitness.  Another teen at the party said Scott and Moises
bragged about slipping the roofie into her soft drink.

Other roofie-rapes are more difficult to prosecute because of the
victims' loss of memory of the incident.  "It's very difficult making these
cases," said Dennis Nicewander, an  assistant state attorney in the Broward
sex-crimes unit.  "Usually these victims don't remember a thing.

"It's almost like the perfect crime,"  he said.  "Because they don't
have to worry about a witness testifying against them.  And don't think
these guys aren't figuring that out."

The drug also has the potential to make rapists out of men who
without the drug might not commit the crime, he said.
"Usually, they aren't the kind of guys who would force themselves on
someone for sex.  They seem to be the kind of guys you'd see at
happy hour with their buddies, the kind of frat-boy mentality that thinks
it's fun to get a girl drunk and have their way."

The drug also works it's way out of the human system usually within
24 hours, he said, which makes any delay by the victim a problem.
"Many of these kids start out in a compromising position to begin
with, then this happens to them and they are scared and embarrassed and
unclear as to what happened," said Stan Peacock, a Broward prosecutor.
"I have told my 17-year-old daughter never to accept a beverage of
any kind from anyone unless it is in a sealed container that she opens
herself," he said.  "Does that give you any kind of an idea how concerned
I am about it?"
