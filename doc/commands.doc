   The commands list can be found under 'commands su' and you will be able to
access this help file even if you do not have the commands as a psuedo super 
user (channel only).   (This file is huge, so dont be out in the main room
and jabbying to you friends while reading it.)

	ask     	A nice way to warn someone if you have already asked 
			someone in a tell to behave.   It shows up on their
			screen all nice and hitelled and looks official.

	assist  	Shows a clueless newbie thta you are an SU and if they 
			need help they can come to you.   (type assist me to
			what they would see)

	banish  	basically used if someone continually comes on with
			an offensive (unfortunately this occurs repeatedly
			once it starts happening a first time).

	blank		used to blank something like blank title vallie	would
			blank vallie's title.	Used if someone has something
			offensive in their title, prefix, plan, etc and they
			will not change it when you ask them.

	blankpass	used if a newbie comes on and says that they are
			already a resident and they tell you they forgot their
			password.   Usually its better to pass this onto an
			Admin if they are on because they can check to see
			if the email is valid etc etc.

	ckban		used to search the currently bannes sites file to see
			if a particular site is banned. uses IP addresses
			ckban 137 would look for all currently banned addresses
			that have 137 anywhere in them.
			
	comfy		go to the ever coveted comfy room.   Used for general
			SU and/or Admin discussions.

	confirm		tells you whether or not a newly ressied plater has
			filled out their email and password yet.   A good
			thing to type a minute or so after ressying someone.

	decap		used when people feel the need to continually type
			long strings in caps.   If someone gets their caps
			key turned on once this is acceptable, but repeated
			usage calls for this lil device.
		
	dibbs		used when you want to call 'dibbs' on a player thats a
			newbie or is causing trouble without the annoying 
			message to the player.  Only su's see you call 'dibbs'.

	drag		drags someone off the program for being a repeated git.

	dumb		makes a harassing person sound like a complete baby
			(literally) and their communication is tempered until
			undumb them :)

	extend		makes someone's list longer by five units to a maximum

			to extend someone's list and create lots of red tape.
			For more than 40, an admin must extend the list.

	forcehelp	used to make a player see a certain help file
			forcehelp <player name> <help file>.    Good to show
			a player help 'rules' when theyre being idiots.

	newbies		Can be used to see whether the program is currently
			open or closed to newbies, and you can turn newbies
			on or off by specifying newbies on or newbies off
			if there is enough catastraophe going on to warrant
			closing the program to newbies.

			rid of a newbie, please use drag or splat.   Used
			generally when a player has foregone all other forms
			of punishment and has to be nuked.

	off_duty	Go off duty.    You lose your su commands while off
			duty, and you no longer are on the su channel.  It
			is generally when you go afk or are having some diffi-
			culties that you go off duty to regain some sanity.

			su commands).   You also go back on the list_su list.

			except only SUs see it.

	splat		kicks off a plasyer, and stops newbies from logging

	su_hi		makes the su channel hilighted.   Kewl.

			their email address or are applying for an email
			account in the interim.
	
	warn		is hilighted and beeps and bascially shows a player
			That you're not screwing around with them. It is 
			logged to the program.

	xref		The coolest command we have ;) It lets you search the
			entire resident list and shows you multiple
			matches.   Great for checking to see if a newbie's
			name is too close to someone that's alreayd resident 
			if the newbie asks for residency.

	yoyo		spams the offender's screen and shows them a nasty 
			message to behave or else.  basically a humiliate
			tactic.

	y		see if a player has been warned, how many times,
			who residented them, etcetera etcetera.

    These are just general comments and watching SU's use them in different
situations is the best was to learn - do NOT being a newbie character from
your own site and 'play' with them.
