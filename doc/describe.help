_Description (x-file and f-file)_

These commands are to spice up your examine (x) file and finger (f) 
file.  Some of them are for both files, some are for only one.  They have 
been separated for your convenience.

For Both Files:
age: 
	-To set your age, type: age <number>
		-You must set the age to a numerical value.  It will not 
	 	 recognize anything else.
		-Typing age 0 turns this function off.

birthday (bday):
	-To set your birthday, type: bday <month/date>
		-If you want your birthday to be set to Feb 29, you _must_
		 include the year in the date.  For example: bday 2/29/96.
		 The only time you do not have to include the year, is when
		 it is an actual leap year.
		-Typing bday 0 turns this function off.

description (desc):
	-To set up a description of yourself, type: desc <self depiction>

hometown:
	-To set the location of where you are, type: hometown <place>

madefrom (formerly automatically set based on gender):
	-To set what you are made from, type: madefrom <components>
		-You may now set this to whatever you wish it to be.  If you
		 type madefrom without anything after it, it will default to
		 the old message.

title:
	-To set your own title (because we all need one once we are no longer
	 'new to the playground'), type: title <insert your noble rank here>
		-You do not need to put your name at the beginning of your
		 title.  The program will do it for you automatically.
		-If you prefer to have just your name, and no title after it,
		 type title with no message after it.  (i.e.- type: title)

toggle:
	-To set your email and/or site public for friends or everyone to see,
	 type: toggle <email or site> <friends or everyone>
		-If you do not toggle your email or site, it is assumed that
		 you wish for them to remain private.

url (WWW homepage location):
	-To set the location of your homepage, type: url
	 <location>
		-This is NOT to set up a homepage.  It is only for those who
		 currently have one.


For the Examine (x) File:
favorite:
	-To set up a favorite, type: favorite # <item> <thing>
		-The number must be 1, 2, or 3, as you are only allowed 3
		 favorites.
		-The item may be no longer than 12 characters long.
		-For example: to show that your favorite movie is Star Wars
			-type: favorite 1 movie Star Wars
		-To delete a favorite, type: favorite #
			-Make sure that you have the correct # of the one you
			 wish to remove.  Also, you do not put in an <item> 
			 or <thing> when you are deleting a favorite.

irl_name:
	-To set the name you go by in real life, type: irl_name <name you
	 answer to>


For the Finger (f) File:
plan:
	-To set your plan, type: plan <idea(s) of what to do with your life>
		-If you wish to remove the plan section from your f-file,
		 type plan with no comments after it.  (i.e.- type: plan)

*Note: The examine (x) file is for people to get more info on you when 
you are currently logged in.  The finger (f) file is to get more info 
when you are not currently logged in.


Miscellaneous Personalization Commands (these don't affect the x or f files):

prefix:
	-To set a prefix, type: prefix <msg>
	 	-This has a limit of 16 characters, and will not accept any
		 blank spaces within it.
		-The prefix is also shown to anyone who has the prefix command
		 on whenever you say something, public or private.
		-To see how to turn prefixes on, type help noprefix.

recap:
	-To recapitalize your name in some new fashion, type: recap <name as
	 you want it to appear>
