SU Policy as of 4/22/95

You wanted the ressie policy, theres two basic parts

(1) Bad names - when people use names that are found offensive (usually 
as soon as they log on youll notice) it should be DISCUSSED and if the 
name is agreed to being offensive then it should be changed to 'GuestOne' 
etc. until they can think of a better, less offensive name to use.  The 
same holds for names that insinuate drug connotations.  It should be a 
_calm_ discussion (unlike the ones we had in the past) but basically it 
should be a ganeral consensus - is it is divided then the name should go 
anyway just to be safe and avoid future 'well look at _that_ name' typa
arguments from newbies

(2) Name similarities - In case you can think of a name which seems very 
similar to another like Val and Valley for instance cause ppl use 
shortened forms of names in tells - then you should check to see if there 
is another name on the ressie list (hopefully Noggie will have a command 
that will do this soon for you with out having to type lr <letter>) :)
